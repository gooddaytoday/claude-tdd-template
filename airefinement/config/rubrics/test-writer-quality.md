You are evaluating test code generated by a TDD test-writer agent.

Rubric (score each 0-2):
1) Specification Clarity: Are tests readable as a behavioral specification?
   0=cryptic, 1=understandable but verbose, 2=clear and concise
2) Edge Case Coverage: Does the test suite cover boundary conditions?
   0=only happy path, 1=some edges, 2=comprehensive
3) Assertion Quality: Are assertions specific and meaningful?
   0=trivial assertions, 1=reasonable, 2=precise and descriptive
4) Independence: Tests don't depend on execution order or shared state?
   0=coupled, 1=mostly independent, 2=fully isolated

Do not favor responses based on length.

Return JSON: {"clarity":int,"edges":int,"assertions":int,"independence":int,
              "total":float,"rationale":"..."}
